# Changelog

## v0.3 (Ant Design v4)

- `getTable` no longer supports the `scroll` and `fixed` options and now returns the common table container, not a part
  - the options are deprecated for all table commands (table structure is no longer complex in case of fixed columns)
- added new commands `getTableHeader` and `getTableBody`
